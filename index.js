// The ternary operator is a concise way to write conditional statements in various programming languages. It's called ternary because it takes three operands: a condition followed by two expressions.

// condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false

let n = 11;
let result = n % 2 == 0 ? "even" : "odd";
console.log(result);
